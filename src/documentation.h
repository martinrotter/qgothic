 * QGothic is simple board game written entirely using Qt framework. QGothic was developed primarily
 * for GNU/Linux (with KDE environment) and for Windows 7. Game was tested on those operating systems and
 * should run flawlessly.
 *
 * Note that this document is not user-guide for the QGothic game. It is meant to be used as starting point
 * for anyone who may want to extend QGothic.
 *
 * # Prerequisities For Programmers
 * - Qt (with supported C++ compiler/toolchain)
 * - Doxygen
 *
 * # Hardware Requirements
 * - For building QGothic
 *  + any decent personal computer able to compile C++ source code
 * - For running QGothic
 *  + CPU: single-core pentium os more than enough (x86 or x86-64 architecture)
 *  + HDD: 60 MB of free space (for executable and extra Qt .dll files on Windows, much less free
 *  space needed on Linux)
 *  + RAM: 6-45 MB (QGothic process takes up to 25 MB of memory, tested on GNU/Linux and Windows 7)
 *  + VGA: OpenGL support required (with recompilation there is "graphicssystem raster" possibility
