				<p>QGothic is simple board game developed using Qt framework. It is based on a well-known Altdeutsche Dame.</p>
				
				<h1><a name="general">General</a></h1>
				<p>QGothic is simple checkers-like board game. It can be played in a very similar way to traditional chess, despite little different <a href="#rules">game rules</a>. This game is based on Damn-Spel and Czech Checkers. Altdeutsche Dame has been inferred because of the similarities between south German and Turkish checker rules that Altdeutsche Dame may have influenced Turkish Checkers, invented around 1683.</p>
				
				<h1><a name="rules">Game Rules</a></h1>
				<p>Note that QGothic's rules are different from traditional checkers.</p>
				
				<h3>Beginning of a Game</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>Usually white player starts, but sometimes this can be re-negotiated by players, so that black player can start sometimes too.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>Course of a Game</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>Game is played on rectangular board of 8x8 size.</li>
				<li>Number of player is strictly limited to 2 players.</li>
				<li>Players change in their turns regularly, one move is made during one turn.</li>
				<li>Each player starts with 12 pawns located in 2 southest rows from view of that respective player.</li>
				<li>Pawn can move diagonally by one field forward. Moving backwards is not allowed.</li>
				<li>Pawn can jump opponents's figures. Jumped figure has to be located just next to jumping pawn and field behind victim must be empty.</li>
				<li>These simple pawn jumps can be chained in a jumping sequence.</li>
				<li>If pawn reaches furthest row of board, it is promoted to the queen and move is ended. It's opponent's turn now.</li>
				<li>Queen is allowed to move diagonally to all directions.</li>
				<li>Queen can jump figure in its way, if there is at least one field empty behind jumped figure.</li>
				<li>These simple queen jumps can be chained in a jumping sequence.</li>
				<li>Each player must make a move containing the most available figures. Otherwise any move can be made.</li>
				<li>If player is not able to make any move, then it's opponent's turn.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>Ending of a Game</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>At least one player has no figures remaining.</li>
				<li>There have been made certain number of non-jumping moves. This number is usually 30 moves per player. Winner is the player with more figures in this case. Same number of figures for both player means, that game ended in a draw. Points are given for each remaining figure in this state sometimes. Queens are evaluated by 4 points and pawns by 1 point. Points are summed up for each player and player with more points win. Same number of points means draw again.</li>
				</ol>
				
				
				<h1><a name="starting">Starting/Saving/Loading Games</a></h1>
				<h3>Starting Game</h3>
				<p>Game can be started by triggering Game -> New action or hitting CTRL+N key shortcut. User is asked to save his current game first. If new game is started, then beginning player is loaded from settings. So changing beginning player in a middle of active game has no signification for that actual game, but for newly started games only. But type of both players can be changed in-game and apply for currently active game.</p>
				
				<h3>Loading Game</h3>
				<p>Game can be loaded by triggering Game -> Load action or hitting CTRL+L key shortcut. User is asked to save his current game first. QGothic supports its internal *.qgo files only. If loading fails, it is announced to the user.</p>
				QGothic save game files store variety of things.
				<ul>
				<li>entire history of moves</li>
				<li>difficulty and type of both players</li>
				<li>maximal allowed number of jumped figures</li>
				<li>color of beginning player</li>
				<li>result of the game</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Game is redo-ed to its last move, when it's loaded. So if game contains eg. 50 moves, it's rolled "forward" to the last player move.</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="note-1">NOTE</a>: Games saved under X.Y.Z build cannot be loaded in other versions of QGothic.</p>
				<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="note-1">NOTE</a>: QGothic supports opening saved games from your desktop directly by clicking the saved game and dragging saved games onto QGothic main window too.</p>
				
				<h3>Saving Game</h3>
				<p>Game can be saved by triggering Game -> Save action or hitting CTRL+S key shortcut. Also read the above <a href="#note-1">note</a>.</p>
				
				<h1><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h1>
				Configuration dialog can be accessed by firing Tools -> Configuration action or hitting CTRL+C key shortcut. Configuration dialog allows you to edit some things like:
				<ul>
				<li>type and difficulty of both players</li>
				<li>beginning player etc.</li>
				<li>appearance of application</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h1><a name="misc">Miscellaneous</a></h1>
				
				<h3>Graphical Board</h3>
				<p>Board allows you to view moveable figures which can be highlighted with color when one of them is clicked. Also opponent's moveable figures can be highlighted as well by clicking on any of opponent's figure.</p>
				
				<h3>Pausing and Resuming Game</h3>
				<p>Game <b>mustn't be</b> paused, if human player wants to make his turn. If AI has his turn, game can be paused, but sometimes pausing of game can take several seconds.</p>
